## Performance tips
Performance is often a very important factor. But to be able to optimize and speed up something it is crucial to know how C# runtime and the language itself work. Also keep in mind that you should optimize stuff only when it is really necessary. If something works pretty fast there is no point in waisting your time trying to gain few miliseconds speed up unless you develop some real time software or a game.

### Measuring performance
The most basic thing if you want to optimize a code is to measure its performance. You cannot do some real optimization if you cannot measure how long a code executes. There quite many ways how to measure performance, here you will see few basic easy to implement methods.

##### Method 1
```csharp
DateTime start = DateTime.UtcNow;

// some code to measure

DateTime stop = DateTime.UtcNow;
int measuredTime = (stop - start).TotalMilliseconds;
```
It is a quite fast method, but with low accuracy - requires many loops over measured code. May give unrealiable results if system time changes while measurements are taken.

##### Method 2
```csharp
TimeSpan start = Process.GetCurrentProcess().TotalProcessorTime;

// some code to test

TimeSpan stop = Process.GetCurrentProcess().TotalProcessorTime;
int measuredTime = (stop - start).TotalMilliseconds;
```
Slow method, but with good accuracy, it uses different mechanism - measures how long CPU was busy, not how much time passed. Important things to note are that time inside sleep is not counted, but excution on two CPUs is counted as 200%!

##### Method 3
```csharp
Stopwatch watch = new Stopwatch();
watch.Start();

// some code to test

watch.Stop();
int measuredTime = (int)watch.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds;
```
This method has a very good accuracy and is quite common. Two methods can be very useful while working with **Stopwatch** class: 
* **Reset** - stops and sets the result to 0
* **Restart** - stops, sets the result to 0 and starts again

### GC object's generations
Garbage Collector puts every object in one of 3 levels called generations. Generation 0 holds small short living objects. It is the fastest generation, but it is also the smallest one. Generation 2 is the slowest, but also the biggest one. It holds big objects that are supposed to be used many times in the application lifetime. Generation 1 is something in between of generatons 0 and 2. If you want to know in which generation is given object hold, use the following code:
```csharp
byte[] data = new byte[90000]; 
GC.GetGeneration(data); //returns 0, 1 or 2 [here 2]
```
Large objects, over 85000 bytes are stored in Large Object Heap (LOH), which is not divided by generations.

### Fast binary string comparison
```csharp
String.Equals("test", "TEST", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
```

### Decimal vs. double
**Double** and **float** store numbers in the base of 2, while **Decimal** stores numbers in the base of 10. Double and float are much faster because the processor can work on them directly. On the other hand Decimal is much more accurate in calculations.

### Reference and value types
Objects are given as reference by default. Value types and structs are given by value, **ref** and **out** keywords have any meaning only when they are used with them.<br />
Value types cannot be modified. Every time when some kind of modification is tried to be done, a new new value is created instead. That's why for example if you want to modify some string many times, it is recomended to use **StringBuilder** class. See an example:
```csharp
//in such little example it is ok, but for much more modifications it is not a good way   
string tmp1 = "a" + "b" + "c"; 

StringBuilder tmp2 = new StringBuilder();
tmp2.append("a").append("b").append("c");
```
In case of reference types it is important to remember that their values are not copied, but they reference are. In the following example both `tmp1` and `tmp2` are references to **the same object**:
```csharp
List<int> tmp1;
List<int> tmp2 = tmp1; 
```

### Performance tips
* Avoid boixng and uboxing (casting variables to **object**) - use `int[]` and `List<int>` instead of **List** and **ArrayList**
* Use **StringBuilder** - it uses the pointer to the string internally and does not create new string every time you try to modify it.
* Array of int (`int[]`) is faster than list of int (`List<int>`) and faster than anything else actually.
* For loop is faster than foreach loop while iterating lists (but both are very fast for `int[]`).
* Do NOT use two-dimensional arrays. Instead flatten the array. Instead of indexing the array like this `[x, y]`, you will have to this like this `[x * columns + y]`. If you cannot flatten the array (probably always you can) better use jagged arrays than two-dimensional.
* If it is possible avoid throwing exceptions and never catch general exceptions of **Exception** class.
* Use `int.TryParse` instead of `int.Parse` - **TryParse** doesn't throw exceptions.
* Use many small and short living objects, don't let them to be put into 1 and 2 generation of GC and use few large and long living objects that will be put on large objects heap. This way you will go along with Garbage Collector strategy and take advantage of it.

### Intermediate language
Programs written in C# are translated to [**Common Intermediate Language** (CIL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language). This is a language which looks like Assembler a bit with and it is then executed by the .NET Runtime. That's why C# applications can be portable because if you have .NET Runtime installed on your operating system you will be able to run C# program. It is not mandatory to know CIL and its instructions but it is quite advisable to at least understand some most basic concepts of how C# programs look after compilation to CIL.<br />
Here you can see some most basic instructions (this is not an example of a program):
```
ldc.i4.1       //load constant 1 as integer 32bit and put it on stack
ldloc.0        //load value from variable location 0 and put it on stack
stloc.1        //take a value from the top of stack and store it in variable location 1
add            //add two top values on stack
bne #000000a   //branch not equal - go to given instruction if two top values on stack are not equal
br #000000a    //branch to given instruction
```
And here you can see an example.<br/>
C# code:
```csharp
array[5] = 10;
```
CIL code:
```
ldloc.0     /// array
ldc.i4.5    /// [5]
ldc.i4.s 10 /// 10
stelem.i4   /// =
```
[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CIL_instructions) you can see the whole list of instructions. You can decompile .NET programs with **ildasm.exe**. You can find it usually in the following path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v8.1A\bin\NETFX 4.5.1 Tools` and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-2.0/f7dy01k1(v=vs.80)) you can find the docs.
