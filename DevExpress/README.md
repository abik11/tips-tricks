# DevExpress
This is not a documentation or a complete tutorial, just a bunch of tricks and tips that have been useful to me while working with an amazing libraries shipped by DevExpress. DevExpress has a huge and very detailed documentation, but sometimes it is difficult to find something there because of its size so I hope you will find something useful or interesting here.
