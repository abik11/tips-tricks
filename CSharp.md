# CSharp
Oh C#... the language of love! :D The one to rule them all, the best of the bests :D This document will be constantly in progress, at least I hope so. It is not a from zero to hero guide to teach C# language. It is rather some gathering of things that was useful for me while working as programmer, especially from my beginnings.

## Language tips

### CSC Compiler
If you want to test some little piece of code and creating a new solution in Visual Studio is defenietely waste of time for you for such a little piece, than you can use CSC compiler directly from command line, see how to do it:
```powershell
$cscPath = "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319"
$cscFullPath = "$cscPath\csc.exe"
& "$cscFullPath" /out:program.exe /target:exe program.cs
```
If you need to add some DLL's you have to use `/r` switch:
```powershell
& "$cscFullPath" /r:System.DirectoryServices.dll, System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.dll /out:program.exe /target:exe program.cs
```

### IDisposable
Every class that has some unmanaged resources should implement **IDisposable** interface. It is because Garbage Collector knows nothing about such resources. Here is an example of implementation proposed by Microsoft:
```csharp
public class MyClass : IDisposable
{
   private bool isDisposed=false;

   public void Dispose()
   {
      Dispose(true);
      GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
   }

   protected void Dispose(bool disposing)
   {
      if(!isDisposed)
      {
         if(disposing)
         {
            // free MANAGED resources
         }
         // free UNMANAGED resources
      }
      isDisposed=true;
   }

   ~MyClass() 
   {
      Dispose(false);
   }
}
```

### Syntax
There are many nice syntax construction that may help you a lot while working with C#. With every new version of the language there is also some nice new syntactic sugar added. Here you will find few examples from basic to some less known language constructions.

##### Extension methods
```csharp
static bool Contains(this string keyString, char c)
{
   return keyString.IndexOf(c) >= 0;
}

bool test = "Some string".Contains('s');
```

##### User-defined conversion
```csharp
public class Digit
{
   public Digit(double d) { val = d; }
   public double val;

   // User-defined conversion from Digit to double
   public static implicit operator double(Digit d)
   {
      return d.val;
   }

   //  User-defined conversion from double to Digit
   public static implicit operator Digit(double d)
   {    
      return new Digit(d);
   }
}
```
Keep in mind that implicit conversion should **never** throw any exception or lose data. If you cannot fullfil those conditions you should rather implement explicit conversion.

##### Check if integer is not overflowing the maximum value
```csharp
checked {
   int value = int.MaxValue;
   value += 1;
}
```
The code above will throw **OverflowException** if the variable `value` will exceed the maximum integer value, instead of for example giving a strange result.

##### Logical consequence
Logical consequence, also known as logical implication or entailment, is one of the basic boolean operation, but there is no logical operator in C# that implements it. You can use the following boolean operation to implement logical consequence:
```csharp
bool a = true;
bool b = false;

bool consequence = ( !a || b );
```
Here you can see what are the results of the consequence for different boolean values:
```
a   b   
0   0   (!0 || 0) = 1 || 0 = 1
1   0   (!1 || 0) = 0 || 0 = 0
0   1   (!0 || 1) = 1 || 1 = 1
1   1   (!1 || 1) = 0 || 1 = 1
```

### Enums

##### Enums with descriptions
Descriptions may be useful if you want to list enums to display them to user, it is very easy to add them:
```csharp
using System.ComponentModel;

public enum Result 
{
   [Description("No result")]
   None = 0,
   [Description("Correct result")]
   Correct = 1
}
```

##### Get description - extension method
Here is an example of an extension method that will allow you to get the description of given enum value:
```csharp
public static string GetDescription(this Enum value)
{
   Type type = value.GetType();
   string name = Enum.GetName(type, value);
   if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
   {
      FieldInfo field = type.GetField(name);
      if (field != null)
      {
         DescriptionAttribute descriptionAttribute = 
            (DescriptionAttribute)Attribute.GetCustomAttribute(field, typeof(DescriptionAttribute));
         if (descriptionAttribute != null)
            return descriptionAttribute.Description;
       }
   }
   return string.Empty;
}
```

##### Iterate through all enum values
```csharp
foreach(EnumType value in Enum.GetValues(typeof(EnumType)))
{
   Console.WriteLine(value.GetDescription());
}
```

### Image and byte arrays

##### Convert Image to byte[]
```csharp
MemoryStream mstream = new MemoryStream();
image.Save(mstream, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Png);
byte[] bytes  = mstream.ToArray();
```

##### Convert byte[] to Image
```csharp
MemoryStream mstream = new MemoryStream(imageBytes);
Image image = Image.FromStream(mstream);
```

##### Image file MIME type
```csharp
ImageCodecInfo codec = ImageCodecInfo.GetImageDecoders().FirstOrDefault(x => x.FormatID == image.RawFormat.Guid);
string fileMimeType = codec.MimeType;
```

##### Write byte array to file
```csharp
System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes("fileName", data); 
```

### Collections

##### Get value from dictionary
```csharp
string value = String.Empty;
dictionary.TryGetValue("Key", out value);
```

##### Add an element to IEnumerable 
```csharp
someIEnumerableOfString.Concat(new[]{ "new element" });
```

### Current week number
```csharp
DateTimeFormatInfo dtFormatInfo = DateTimeFormatInfo.CurrentInfo;
Calendar calendar = dtFormatInfo.Calendar;
int currentWeek = calendar.GetWeekOfYear(DateTime.Now, dtFormatInfo.CalendarWeekRule, DayOfWeek.Sunday);
```

### Sending mails
```csharp
public void SendMail(string subject, string body, List<string> recipients, string attachment = null)
{
   string recipientsString = string.Join(",", recipients);
   SendMail(subject, body, recipientsString, attachment);
}

public void SendMail(string subject, string body, string recipients, string attachment = null)
{
   MailMessage mail = new MailMessage();
   SmtpClient SmtpServer = new SmtpClient("203.204.205.206");
   mail.From = new MailAddress("j.smith@evilcorp.com");
   mail.Subject = subject;
   mail.SubjectEncoding = Encoding.UTF8;
   mail.Body = body;
   mail.To.Add(recipients);
   mail.BodyEncoding = Encoding.UTF8;
   mail.IsBodyHtml = true;

   if (attachment != null)
   {
      Attachment attachmentM = new Attachment(attachment);
      mail.Attachments.Add(attachment);
   }

   SmtpServer.Send(mail);
}
```

### Write to Windows Event Log
```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;

string eventSource = "MyApp";
string log = "Application";

if (!EventLog.SourceExists(eventSource))
   EventLog.CreateEventSource(eventSource, log);

EventLog eventLog = new EventLog();
eventLog.Source = eventSource;
eventLog.Log = log;
eventLog.WriteEntry("Test message", EventLogEntryType.Information);
```

### Get property value with reflection
```csharp
object GetAnyPropertyValue<T>(object obj, string propertyName)
{
   List<PropertyInfo> properties = typeof(T).GetProperties().ToList();
   PropertyInfo property = properties.First(x => x.Name == propertyName);

   if(property != null && obj != null)
   {
        return property.GetValue(obj);
   }
   
   return null;
}
```

## Performance and under the hood
Performance is often a very important factor. But to be able to optimize and speed up something it is crucial to know how C# runtime and the language itself work. Also keep in mind that you should optimize stuff only when it is really necessary. If something works pretty fast there is no point in waisting your time trying to gain few miliseconds speed up unless you develop some real time software of a game.

### Measuring performance
The most basic thing if you want to optimize a code is to measure its performance. You cannot do some real optimization if you cannot measure how long a code executes. There quite many ways how to measure performance, here you will see few basic easy to implement methods.

##### Method 1
```csharp
DateTime start = DateTime.UtcNow;

// some code to measure

DateTime stop = DateTime.UtcNow;
int measuredTime = (stop - start).TotalMilliseconds;
```
It is a quite fast method, but with low accuracy - requires many loops over measured code. May give unrealiable results if system time changes while measurements are taken.

##### Method 2
```csharp
TimeSpan start = Process.GetCurrentProcess().TotalProcessorTime;

// some code to test

TimeSpan stop = Process.GetCurrentProcess().TotalProcessorTime;
int measuredTime = (stop - start).TotalMilliseconds;
```
Slow method, but with good accuracy, it uses different mechanism - measures how long CPU was busy, not how much time passed. Important things to note are that time inside sleep is not counted, but excution on two CPUs is counted as 200%!

##### Method 3
```csharp
Stopwatch watch = new Stopwatch();
watch.Start();

// some code to test

watch.Stop();
int measuredTime = watch.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds;
```
This method has a very good accuracy and is quite common. Two methods can be very useful while working with **Stopwatch** class: 
* **Reset** - stops and sets the result to 0
* **Restart** - stops, sets the result to 0 and starts again

### GC object's generations
Garbage Collector puts every object in one of 3 levels called generations. Generation 0 holds small short living objects. It is the fastest generation, but it is also the smallest one. Generation 2 is the slowest, but also the biggest one. It holds big objects that are supposed to be used many times in the application lifetime. Generation 1 is something in between of generatons 0 and 2. If you want to know in which generation is given object hold, use the following code:
```csharp
byte[] data = new byte[90000]; 
GC.GetGeneration(data); //returns 0, 1 or 2 [here 2]
```
Large objects, over 85000 bytes are stored in Large Object Heap (LOH), which is not divided by generations.

### Fast binary string comparison
```csharp
String.Equals("test", "TEST", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
```

### Decimal vs. double
**Double** and **float** store numbers in the base of 2, while **Decimal** stores numbers in the base of 10. Double and float are much faster because the processor can work on them directly. On the other hand Decimal is much more accurate in calculations.

### Reference and value types
Objects are given as reference by default. Value types and structs are given by value, **ref** and **out** keywords have any meaning only when they are used with them.<br />
Value types cannot be modified. Every time when some kind of modification is tried to be done, a new new value is created instead. That's why for example if you want to modify some string many times, it is recomended to use **StringBuilder** class. See an example:
```csharp
//in such little example it is ok, but for much more modifications it is not a good way   
string tmp1 = "a" + "b" + "c"; 

StringBuilder tmp2 = new StringBuilder();
tmp2.append("a").append("b").append("c");
```
In case of reference types it is important to remember that their values are not copied, but they reference are. In the following example both `tmp1` and `tmp2` are references to **the same object**:
```
List<int> tmp1;
List<int> tmp2 = tmp1; 
```
